    "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The data team is very satisfied with the initial analysis that they ran using the <strong><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">SageMaker Notebook</span></strong>. They were able to create <span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">meaningful visualizations</span> and manipulate the data to better understand the hidden patterns behind the fraud cases. However, SageMaker Notebooks are a good tool for developers and data scientists. The <span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">management</span> is also interested in these insights and they don&rsquo;t want to start coding. The CEO and CTO expect the team to share their insights via dashboards, as well as develop more visualizations that will support the business operations such as: fraud cases over time.&nbsp;</span></p>\n",
